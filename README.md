Predicting traffic volume is a crucial task for urban planning, traffic management, and reducing environmental impacts. “This study explores the relationship between weather conditions and traffic volume on the Interstate-94 highway using the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset. The dataset includes traffic volume data alongside various weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.” We employ multiple machine learning models, including regression and ensemble methods, to identify patterns and predict traffic volume based on weather conditions. “Feature engineering and statistical analysis are utilized to understand the impact of different weather variables on traffic flow. “The results indicate that weather attributes significantly influence traffic patterns, with temperature and precipitation showing the most substantial correlations. Our models demonstrate promising predictive accuracy, offering insights for real-time traffic management and long-term infrastructure planning.” This research highlights the potential of integrating weather data into traffic prediction systems to enhance urban mobility and safety.
